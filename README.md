## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-   Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
    -   The `Name`, `Email` or `Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
    -   The `Email` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
-   **Bonus**: View actual locations on the contact page map. The addresses we have on the design are fictional, so you'll need to add real addresses for this bonus task. **TODO** : get the GMaps key and finish it
